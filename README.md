This repository contains a small HTML example that hides a contact address from search engines.

## Features

- Displays an address decoded from a Base64 string using JavaScript.
- Includes a `noindex` meta tag so the page is not indexed by search engines.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the decoded address.
